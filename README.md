> The list will keep growing...

Wow. So I found a goldmine of remixes of old classics which are now modernized.. didn't knew it got so advanced..

I think I'll be moving these to spotify.. the visual effect is without any doubt the best. So, I think just because of that I'll leave it over there.. youtube is always on workstations as well last time I checked.. I recall my south asian coworkers listening to tollywood music at work or my american coworkers watching streamers play games while simultaneously getting work done..
while they are waiting for build scripts to run or a monolithic repo to compile..

Those were the days!! Now back in 2025 even something like black coffee could potentially get politicized because attaching a political identity to everything and anything is our thing now. The new normal..

Repo name has changed. For the foreign audience, here's the definition of **Desi**
