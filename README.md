Copy pasta full commit msg with some edits.. tryna not be shy.. it's 2025 Dawg!!

I vibe-coded the c++ projects while listening to these songs. Needed some motivation. Lmao.

projects -> https://github.com/anish7610/learn-cpp/tree/main/projects

FYI I never listen to music while coding like others do and I have been only listening to Spanish music for years.

This is good for a change because ironically I am now foreign to home-grown music.. I strongly believe in the saying and practice it whole-heartedly, "When in rome do as the romans do."

So I found a goldmine of remixes of old classics which are now modernized.. didn't knew it got so advanced.. long time but feels great back to being a normal indian guy.. who codes and listens to bollywood.. cannot get anymore simpler than that. Life is good!
