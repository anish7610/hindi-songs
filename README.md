Wow. So I found a goldmine of remixes of old classics which are now modernized.. didn't knew it got so advanced..

I think I'll be moving these to spotify.. the visual effect is without any doubt the best. So, I think just because of that I'll leave it over there.. youtube is always on workstations as well last time I checked.. Enjoy!!

Repo name has changed. For the foreign audience, here's the definition of **Desi**

I also had another one created almost a year ago that had 90's hits.. will have it created again..
